Software Document recommendation on Operating Platforms.

The client for this recommendation was the Gaming Room for their existing game Draw it or Lose it. Their game was android based and were looking to convert to a multi platform environment allowing many games sessions with multiplayer. The goal for this client is to design a system architecture that could scale, organized and support concurrency without problems.
My strong suit was clearly mapping and understanding the relationships between classes and how the Singleton pattern would control game creation. the structure was clean and easy to follow.
The Design document allows me to reduce confusion when it is time to code. This allows for a clear and concise path for what how Game, Team, and Player will connect when it is time to code rather than guessing.
I will revise my platform comparison to add more to my recommendation section. I believe giving more reasons and specifics on each OS will allow for a better recommendation with cost, performance and scalabilty rather than keeping it broad.
with this recommendation it was important to focus on the users need because it plays an important role in the solution. The client wants to be able to have multiple games at once with the ability to scale. Linux overall was the best one to check off these needs for the client with central services ability, scalabilty and support in all major cloud platforms.
The design approach was seperated into components to understand the responsibility for each part. This create a good work flow to understand the UML Diagram, system constraints, and maintaining clear seperation of concerns.
